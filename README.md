# snmp4j

This is an unofficial fork off the original [snmp4j](http://www.snmp4j.org/) without a 
original name yet. The fork was created because I wanted to delve deep into snmp4j and 
understand certain characteristics. Once I did that i discovered certain things i didn't
like and started fixing it. That's where everything is now.
